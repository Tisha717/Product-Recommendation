# Product-Recommendation

For this Project, I used Jupyter Notebook, where i developed the code. I imported a dataset from Kaggle containing files of different products available on Amazon onto my desktop, and then onto jupyter after that.

Used ML to build a recommendation system. The system predicts or recommends products to users based on their preferences and past experiences with similar products. The recommendation system uses the TfidfVectorizer to convert textual data into numerical features and the linear kernel to compute product similarity scores.
